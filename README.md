> I might improve this by adding the meaning of STEM acronym somewhere in the plot. (Science, Technology, Engineering & Mathematics)
- Suprisingly, male students conquered engineering, manufacture and construction courses just by a small gap. (expected more tbh)
- Female students take the lead on science, mathematics, computer and health & welfare courses
  - Female students tend to be more theoritical than male students
